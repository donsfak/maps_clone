# maps_clone

* First time I use Google maps in a project so I wanted to practice using it.
In a first project implement and make simulations between 2 places to obtain the distance.
Then in a 2nd project clone an uber.

* You need to configure your API key in google cloud and implement it in the project.this key is confidential.
